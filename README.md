## Overview

This expert advisor trades multiple currency pairs based on triple correlation analysis. It aims to maximize profits while mitigating risks. The code includes functions for triple correlation analysis, maximizing profits, mitigating risk, executing trades, and managing trades effectively.

## Global Variables Declaration

- `Risk_value`: A double variable representing the risk level for mitigating potential losses. Default value is set to 0.25.

## Expert Advisor Initialization Function

The `OnInit()` function is responsible for initializing necessary variables and indicators, as well as setting up trading parameters. It should be called once during the initialization of the expert advisor.

## Expert Advisor Execution Function

The `OnTick()` function is the main execution function of the expert advisor. It performs triple correlation analysis to identify trading opportunities, implements strategies to maximize profits based on triple correlation patterns, checks risk level and mitigates potential losses, executes trades automatically based on identified opportunities, and manages trades effectively with trade entry, exit, stop loss, and take profit levels. This function is called on every tick of the selected trading instrument.
